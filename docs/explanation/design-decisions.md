# Design decisions

The table below records the key design choices behind planwerk-review and the
rationale for each.

| # | Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Claude Code invocation** | Once for the entire PR | More efficient; Claude sees full context across files |
| 2 | **Pattern delivery** | Inline in the prompt before `/review` | Patterns are prepended to the `/review` command so Claude considers them during its built-in review |
| 3 | **Result parsing** | Second Claude call for structuring | `/review` returns unstructured text; a second `claude -p` call converts it to JSON matching the `ReviewResult` schema |
| 4 | **Authentication** | `gh auth` | Simplest setup; leverages existing developer workflow |
| 5 | **Review caching** | Based on PR HEAD SHA | Avoids repeated reviews of unchanged PR state |
| 6 | **Propose: two-step Claude** | Analysis → Structure | First call explores codebase freely; second call converts to strict JSON schema |
| 7 | **Propose: cache invalidation** | Based on default branch HEAD SHA | Cache key includes the default-branch HEAD (resolved via `gh api graphql` so private repos work), so proposals refresh when the repo changes |
| 8 | **Propose: output formats** | Markdown, JSON, Issues, Interactive | Markdown for reading, JSON for automation, Issues for templates, `--create-issues` for interactive `gh issue create` |
| 9 | **Review prompt structure** | Multi-section structured prompt | Persona framing, scope analysis, two-pass checklist, suppressions, and anti-sycophancy rules produce higher-quality, more consistent reviews (inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)) |
| 10 | **Actionability classification** | auto-fix / needs-discussion / architectural | Helps teams prioritize which findings to address immediately vs. discuss first |
| 11 | **Scope drift detection** | PR title + body analyzed before code review | Catches scope creep and missing requirements — often the most valuable review feedback |
| 12 | **PR comment posting** | `--post-review` updates existing comment | Idempotent: detects and replaces prior planwerk-review comment via HTML signature. Truncates to GitHub's 65 536-char limit. |
| 13 | **Adversarial review** | `--thorough` runs a second pass | Independent security-focused review merged with primary results, deduplicating by file+line+title |
| 14 | **Coverage map** | `--coverage-map` maps changed functions to tests | Produces a table rating each changed function's test coverage (★★★/★★/★/GAP) with separate E2E gap analysis for projects using Chainsaw or similar frameworks |
| 15 | **External command timeouts** | All `claude`, `gh`, `git` calls have timeouts | Claude: 15 min, git clone: 5 min, gh: 2 min — prevents indefinite blocking |
| 16 | **Test & doc verification** | Dedicated prompt section + checklist items for test/doc completeness | Missing tests and documentation are the most common review gaps; explicit checks at SEMANTIC severity ensure they are flagged consistently. E2E test detection covers Chainsaw (`chainsaw-test.yaml`), kuttl, Helm chart tests, and generic `e2e/` directories |
| 17 | **Enriched findings** | Code snippets, suggested fixes, confidence, fix class, line ranges, relationships | Enables downstream tooling (Claude Code, CI) to process, apply, and correlate findings programmatically |
| 18 | **Inline review comments** | `--inline` posts via GitHub Review API with `suggestion` syntax | Puts findings exactly where the code is; auto-fix suggestions become one-click "Apply suggestion" buttons on GitHub |
| 19 | **Machine-readable comment** | HTML comment with counts + verdict in Markdown output | CI scripts and Claude Code can parse review results without processing full Markdown |
| 20 | **Compact Markdown format** | Empty sections skipped, single-line metadata, GitHub Alert syntax | Reduces noise for human readers and GitHub rendering; no "No findings." placeholders |
| 21 | **Audit: reuse finding schema** | Same `ReviewResult`/`Finding` types as review | Audit findings drop straight into existing tooling, filters, and renderers — no parallel schema to maintain |
| 22 | **Audit: verdict phrasing** | `Action required` / `Improvements suggested` / `Codebase healthy` | PR merge verdicts (`Do not merge` / `Ready to merge`) do not apply to a full-codebase audit; audit-specific phrasing avoids misleading readers |
| 23 | **Audit: no patterns = error** | `audit` fails fast when no patterns load | An audit with zero patterns would produce an unfocused, generic review; surfacing the misconfiguration is better than silently running it |
| 24 | **Adaptive specialist gating** | Skip specialists whose relevant paths the diff does not touch | A small or docs-only PR should not spin up all six specialists; gating cuts wall-clock and cost. `security` and `data-migration` always run because a missed vulnerability or destructive migration is too costly to gate; an unknown diff fails open so nothing is silently skipped |
| 25 | **Structured-output validation** | Reject schema-invalid findings and repair, not normalize | After decoding, `ReviewResult.Validate` rejects an empty title, off-enum severity, and off-enum confidence, triggering one bounded Claude repair round rather than letting `NormalizeConfidence`/`NormalizeActionability` mask schema drift with placeholder defaults. Failing at the boundary keeps bad data from leaking to downstream consumers |
| 26 | **Output language** | Every generated artifact in English; only the `draft` clarifying questions follow the input language | A shared `outputLanguageBlock` pins every plan, fix/implementation report, review, audit, analysis, and drafted issue to English regardless of the input language, so artifacts stay consistent even when issues, seeds, and code comments are written in another language. The single exception is the `draft` command's clarifying Q&A, which is asked in the author's own language so they can answer comfortably — the drafted issue itself is still written in English |
| 27 | **Artifact preamble stripping** | Anchor each posted artifact on its mandated heading and drop everything before it | The plan, fix report, and implementation report prompts all demand the artifact *only*, but models routinely prepend conversational lines ("The branch is published. Final report:"). A shared `sanitizeReport` helper strips a wrapping markdown fence and any preamble before the artifact's heading (`## Implementation Plan`, `## Fix Report`, `## Implementation Report`) so the issue/PR comment carries the artifact alone. Output with no heading is returned unchanged so a bare `STATUS:` escalation — which the orchestrator parses — still survives |
