// newShipCmd builds the "ship" subcommand: the unattended fleet driver that
// takes a Meta Issue and autonomously drives every one of its Sub Issues to
// merged on the default branch, in dependency order. It composes the implement
// pipeline and the fix CI self-heal loop per Sub Issue, reads the dependency DAG
// from GitHub's native blocked_by relationships, and merges with the rebase
// method by default — fixing its own CI rather than handing failing checks back
// to a human.

	shipCmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "ship <issue-ref>",
		Short: "Autonomously implement, CI-fix, and merge every Sub Issue of a Meta Issue",
		Long: `Take a Meta Issue — the kind the "meta" command produces — and drive every
one of its Sub Issues to merged on the default branch, in dependency order,
without a human in the loop. Where "implement" is supervised and deliberately
stops at a draft pull request, "ship" makes those decisions itself: for each
Sub Issue it runs the full implement pipeline, marks the opened PR ready, waits
for CI, fixes red CI itself (reusing the "fix" loop), and merges when green,
then advances to the next ready Sub Issue.

Sub Issues are processed in the order their dependencies allow: ship reads the
native "blocked by" relationships "meta" records and works them topologically,
so a Sub Issue becomes eligible only once every Sub Issue it is blocked by has
merged. Independent Sub Issues stay independently shippable. When a Sub Issue
cannot be finished autonomously — implement reports BLOCKED/NEEDS_CONTEXT, CI
stays red past the fix budget, or the PR will not merge — ship skips it and
everything transitively blocked by it, then continues with any remaining Sub
Issue whose blockers have all merged. The failed Sub Issue's PR is left open
with its report for a human to pick up.

ship narrates its progress on the Meta Issue and posts a final summary; because
state lives in GitHub (closed Sub Issues, merged PRs), a re-run resumes
naturally, skipping past Sub Issues that have already merged. When every Sub
Issue has merged, the Meta Issue is closed.

Merges use the rebase method by default (--merge-method), preserving the
per-commit history the simplify/review passes curate. ship honors branch
protection: it refuses to merge past a required check or review and never force-
merges. Use --no-merge to run the whole pipeline but stop at green CI, leaving
the merges to a human, and --dry-run to report the planned order without cloning
or calling Claude.

or short form (owner/repo#123).`,
