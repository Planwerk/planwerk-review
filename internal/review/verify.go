// verifyFindingSnippets enforces the quote-or-demote gate (#23): a finding
// whose code_snippet cannot be located in the changed files is downgraded to
// "uncertain" confidence — never dropped — so the renderer routes it to the
// Unverified section. This targets the largest false-positive class in LLM
// review (a hallucinated "this symbol does not exist" finding quotes code that
// is not actually there) while preserving a legitimate finding that merely
// quoted an imprecise snippet.
//
// Matching is whitespace- and diff-marker-insensitive so indentation or a
// leading +/- carried over from git diff output never causes a false demotion.
// It returns the number of findings demoted.
//
// When no changed-file content can be loaded (empty diff, unreadable checkout)
// the gate is skipped entirely and nothing is demoted: without ground truth a
// "not found" result is meaningless and would spuriously bury every finding.
