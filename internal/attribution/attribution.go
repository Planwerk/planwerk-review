// Package attribution centralizes the self-attribution that planwerk-review
// stamps on every artifact it leaves on GitHub — issue bodies, pull request
// descriptions, review comments, thread replies — and prints in its CLI
// previews. Holding the wording in one leaf package (importable by every
// renderer without an import cycle back into the claude package) stops the
// copies from drifting, the same way internal/claude/components.go centralizes
// the shared prompt blocks.
//
// The convention this package pins is the prose-side companion to the
// Assisted-by commit-trailer convention (see commitTrailerBlock in the claude
// package): every artifact names the exact Claude model that produced it. The
// orchestrator passes Claude Code only a model alias ("opus"); the resolved id
// ("claude-opus-4-8") is known only at runtime, so each Claude session returns
// it to the caller, which threads it per-run into AssistantWith. Keeping the
// model out of package-level state lets concurrent runners render their own
// model without leaking each other's. When no model is known — a footer
// rendered with no session behind it — the attribution falls back to a bare
// "with Claude" rather than guessing an id.
//
// Every footer also names the planwerk-review build that produced it — the same
// string "planwerk-review --version" prints — placed right after the repository
// link so the report headers and the issue/PR/comment footers read identically.
// Unlike the per-run model id, the version is a process-wide fact recorded once
// at startup (SetVersion) and read back by Tool(); renderers that already
// receive it as a parameter pass it to ToolWithVersion directly.
