// AddressResult is the structured result the address command's per-thread (or
// aggregate) Claude session returns: for each addressed review thread, what the
// follow-up commit changed and the per-thread terminal status, plus an overall
// summary and the run's terminal status. Unlike the other schemas in
// schema/, this contract is the address session's own output (decoded via
// decodeJSONWithRepair), not a `--format json` stdout payload — the address
// command has no `--format json` mode. It is the contract described by
// schema/address-result.schema.json.

	// BLOCKED, NEEDS_CONTEXT — the orchestrator escalates on the last two.

// AddressedThread is the per-thread verdict: the GraphQL thread ID the session
// acted on, its terminal status, a one-line summary of the change, and the

// thread it could not address).
