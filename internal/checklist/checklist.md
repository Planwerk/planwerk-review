## Review Checklist (work through systematically)

### Pass 1 — CRITICAL (always check these)

- [ ] SQL & Data Safety: raw queries, missing parameterization, unsafe migrations, string interpolation in SQL (even if values are cast to int/float — use parameterized queries)
- [ ] Race Conditions: shared mutable state, missing locks, concurrent map access, TOCTOU races (check-then-set patterns that should be atomic WHERE + UPDATE), find-or-create without unique DB index
- [ ] Error Handling: swallowed errors, missing nil checks, panic-worthy paths, error handling that silently drops context
- [ ] Security: hardcoded secrets, injection vectors, auth/authz gaps, unsafe HTML rendering (html_safe, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, v-html) on user-controlled data
- [ ] Input Validation: unvalidated user input at system boundaries, missing format validation on structured data
- [ ] LLM Output Trust Boundary: LLM-generated values (emails, URLs, names) written to DB or passed to mailers without format validation; structured tool output accepted without type/shape checks before database writes
- [ ] Crypto & Entropy: weak RNG for security-sensitive values (use crypto/rand, not math/rand), truncation of data instead of hashing, non-constant-time comparisons on secrets or tokens, deprecated algorithms

### Pass 2 — SEMANTIC (requires tracing beyond the diff)

- [ ] Enum & Value Completeness: when the diff introduces a new enum value, status string, tier name, or type constant — trace it through EVERY consumer. Read each file that switches on, filters by, or displays that value. Check allowlists/filter arrays containing sibling values. Check case/if-elsif chains for fallthrough to wrong default.
- [ ] Conditional Side Effects: code paths that branch on a condition but forget to apply a side effect on one branch (e.g. item promoted but URL only attached conditionally). Log messages that claim an action happened but the action was conditionally skipped.
- [ ] Type Coercion at Boundaries: values crossing language/serialization boundaries where type could change (numeric vs string), hash/digest inputs that don't normalize types, timezone-naive timestamps at API boundaries, JSON parse of user input without schema validation

### Pass 3 — INFORMATIONAL

- [ ] Magic Numbers: unexplained numeric literals used in multiple files, config that should be externalized as named constants
- [ ] Dead Code: unused functions, unreachable branches, commented-out code, variables assigned but never read
- [ ] Test Gaps: untested error paths, missing edge cases, negative-path tests that assert type/status but not side effects
- [ ] Performance & Bundle Impact: N+1 queries (missing eager loading), unbounded allocations, missing pagination, known-heavy dependencies (moment.js, lodash full), large static assets committed (>500KB), synchronous script tags without async/defer
- [ ] API Contract: breaking changes to public interfaces without versioning, missing backward compatibility
- [ ] View/Frontend: unescaped user content in templates, missing loading/error states, accessibility regressions, inline style blocks in partials (re-parsed every render)
- [ ] Time Window Safety: date-key lookups that assume "today" covers 24h, mismatched time windows between related features (one uses hourly buckets, another uses daily keys)
