Apply these thinking patterns:
- "Diagnose before patching." — Read every failing log to the bottom. Classify the failure category (build/compile, test, lint/format, type-check, dependency/security scan, infra/flake) BEFORE editing any file.
- "Find the root cause." — A failing assertion is a symptom; the broken invariant in the code under test is the cause. Fix the cause, not the symptom.
- "Reproduce, then verify." — When the failing command can be re-run in this checkout (test, lint, build, type-check), run it locally to reproduce the failure FIRST, then run it again after your edits to confirm the fix BEFORE pushing.
- "Open the file, do not guess." — When a log cites a file:line, open the actual source. Never invent code shapes, error messages, or line numbers from the log alone.
- "Do not cheat the check." — Never disable, skip, or weaken a check to make it pass. Forbidden: t.Skip / pytest.skip / xit / xdescribe added solely to bypass; // nolint, # noqa, # type: ignore, @ts-ignore, @SuppressWarnings added solely to silence; widening types to Any/interface{}/unknown to silence type-checkers; deleting or relaxing assertions; deleting test cases; pinning to an older dependency to dodge a security finding; --no-verify on commits.
- "Minimal-invasive change." — Touch the smallest surface area that resolves each failure. No drive-by refactors, no reformatting unrelated code, no dependency bumps that are not directly implicated.
- "Regression guard." — If the broken behavior is in production code and existing tests did not catch it, extend or add a test that fails before your fix and passes after.
- "Simplify the diff." — Re-read your own diff and remove anything not strictly required. Prefer fewer lines, fewer files, fewer abstractions.
- "Self-review before committing." — Walk through the diff once more as the reviewer. Reject anything you would push back on.
- "Stay inside the PR." — The PR has a stated intent (title + body). Your fix must serve it. Do not change unrelated files.

	sb.WriteString(`## Diagnosis Workflow

Run these steps for EACH failing check above before editing any code:

1. CATEGORIZE the failure from the logs:
   - build/compile error (syntax, missing symbol, broken import)
   - test failure (assertion, panic, timeout)
   - lint / format finding (vet, golangci-lint, ruff, eslint, prettier)
   - type-check error (mypy, basedpyright, tsc, golangci-lint typecheck)
   - dependency / SBOM / security scan finding
   - infra / transient flake (network timeout, expired token, runner OOM)
2. LOCATE the offending code by opening the file at the cited path:line. Do not work from memory of what the log says — open the file.
3. UNDERSTAND THE INTENT: read surrounding code, the relevant test, and the PR title/body. Decide what the code SHOULD do.
4. CHOOSE A FIX STRATEGY:
   - Production code is wrong → fix production code; if no test caught the bug, add or extend one.
   - Test encodes outdated behavior → update the test, and explain in the report WHY the new expectation is correct.
   - Lint/format/type-check finding → apply the real fix (formatter, missing annotation, narrowed type). Suppression comments are forbidden unless they were already idiomatic in this file before this PR.
   - Flake / infra / unreachable secret → STOP and report. Do not commit a placebo fix.
5. APPLY the minimal change. If two failing checks share a single root cause, fix it once.
6. VERIFY LOCALLY: re-run the exact command that failed in CI (or the closest local equivalent — e.g. ` + "`go test ./internal/foo`, `pytest tests/test_x.py::test_y`, `golangci-lint run`, `tsc --noEmit`" + `). Capture the command and pass/fail in your final report. If the command cannot run in this environment, say so explicitly.
7. ADD A REGRESSION TEST when the fix is in production code and the existing suite did not catch the bug. Skip this step ONLY for: lint/format-only fixes, fixes inside test code itself, or fixes for failures that no unit/integration test could plausibly catch (e.g. SBOM signature, runtime infra config).

## What to do

1. Run the diagnosis workflow for every failing check.
2. Apply the minimal change(s).
3. Verify locally where possible. Re-read your diff. Remove anything not required.
4. Self-review the diff against the original PR scope. Stop if your fix is drifting outside it.
5. Stage your changes, create ONE follow-up commit using:

   git add -A
   git commit -m "Fix failing CI checks (iteration ` + fmt.Sprintf("%d", ctx.Iteration) + `)" -m "Failed checks: <comma-separated names>" --trailer "Co-Authored-By: planwerk-review fix <noreply@planwerk>"

6. Push to the PR head branch:

   git push origin HEAD:` + ctx.HeadBranch + `

7. After pushing, output a structured fix report in this exact shape:

   ## Fix Report (iteration ` + fmt.Sprintf("%d", ctx.Iteration) + `)

   ### Per check
   - <check name>
     - Category: <build|test|lint|typecheck|deps|infra>
     - Root cause: <one sentence>
     - Fix: <files touched + one-sentence description of the change>
     - Local verification: <exact command run + pass/fail, OR "not reproducible in this environment — relying on CI">
     - Regression test: <added/extended test name, OR "n/a — <reason from step 7 above>">
   ### Diff summary
   - Files: <comma-separated list>
   - Approx lines added/removed: <+N/-M>

## Hard rules

- NEVER force-push.
- NEVER change files outside the failure surface. If a fix would require it, STOP and explain instead of committing.
- NEVER skip, weaken, or suppress the failing check (see the "Do not cheat the check." pattern above for the explicit forbidden list).
- NEVER skip pre-commit / CI hooks (no --no-verify, no --no-gpg-sign).
- NEVER bump dependencies that the failure log does not directly implicate.
- NEVER fabricate file paths, line numbers, or error messages — open the file before claiming.
- NEVER claim "fixed" without either local verification (step 6) or an explicit "not reproducible locally" note in the report.
- If you cannot diagnose a failure from the logs (truncation, infra flake, expired secret, third-party check without logs), STOP and explain — do not invent a fix.
- If there is nothing to commit after the fix attempt, do NOT create an empty commit; output the report and stop.
- If the same check is failing for the same root cause as the previous iteration, STOP and report — repeating the failed approach will not help.
