A Meta Issue frames a larger body of work as several self-contained work packages. Read it and decide — on your own — which Sub Issues are worth carving out, then describe each at DRAFT depth: enough context to stand on its own and be picked up later, never a file-level plan.

Make the breakdown autonomously. Do NOT ask the author what to split or how — read the Meta Issue and decide. Keep the split deliberately small: group the work into the fewest sensible packages rather than many tiny ones, and never let the breakdown sprawl. Where the Meta Issue already implies an order or dependencies — a foundation package others build on, numbered tiers, lettered workstreams — preserve that structure rather than inventing your own, and key the Sub Issues so that order is clear.

Coverage is a hard criterion: when the Meta Issue itself enumerates work packages (a checkbox list, numbered tiers, lettered workstreams), every listed package maps to exactly ONE Sub Issue and every Sub Issue maps back to a listed package — do NOT drop a listed package to keep the split small, do NOT merge two listed packages into one Sub Issue, and do NOT invent a package the Meta Issue never describes. The fewest-packages rule governs only work the Meta Issue does not already enumerate.

` + draftHardNonGoalsBlock() + `
Each Sub Issue is a draft, not a plan. Turning a Sub Issue into a file-level engineering plan is the job of the separate elaborate and implement commands, run per Sub Issue when the author is ready. If you catch yourself writing acceptance criteria, an affected-areas list, or implementation steps, stop — that belongs to a later step.

Describe each Sub Issue by the behavior and interfaces it changes — what users and callers see — because a Sub Issue sits in the tracker and may be carved off and picked up long after the surrounding code has moved; a behavioral brief outlives one pinned to today's file layout.

Carve each Sub Issue as a vertical slice: it cuts end-to-end through every layer it touches and is demoable on its own, rather than a horizontal layer (all the types here, all the wiring there) that delivers nothing until a sibling lands.

- A short, stable key that encodes any implied order — "a", "b", "c" for lettered workstreams; "tier-1", "tier-2" for numbered tiers; "foundation" for a package others build on. Keys are lowercase, hyphenated, and unique.
` + draftTitleLine() + `- A Description: a few short paragraphs framing this work package and what it delivers, in plain terms a maintainer can pick up. Draft depth only.
- A Motivation: why this package matters and what depends on it.
` + draftScopeLine() + `- An honest "blockedBy" ordering: the keys of the sibling packages this one must wait on, or [] when it is unblocked. Record the dependency here as structured data, NOT as prose in the Description — the runner persists it as a real GitHub "blocked by" relationship so the order is machine-readable and renders in GitHub's issue UI. Keep it minimal: list only the siblings this package genuinely cannot start without, so packages with no real dependency stay grabbable in parallel, and never let the dependencies form a cycle.

## Syncing the Meta Issue body

Return the Meta Issue body in "metaBody", edited ONLY to mark where each Sub Issue reference belongs:
- Reproduce the body VERBATIM. Change nothing except inserting placeholder tokens.
- Where the body carries a work-package list or section — a checkbox list, numbered tiers, lettered workstreams — insert the token {{sub:KEY}} on the existing line for that package, using the matching Sub Issue key. The runner replaces each token with the created issue's #number so the prose and the sub-issue list agree.
- Insert ONE token per work-package line, and only on lines that already describe a package, and use each declared key on exactly ONE line. Do not add, remove, reorder, or reword any line.
- If the body carries no such list, return it UNCHANGED with no tokens.
- Every {{sub:KEY}} you insert MUST use a key you declared in "subIssues".
