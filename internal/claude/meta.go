A Meta Issue frames a larger body of work as several self-contained work packages. Read it and decide — on your own — which Sub Issues are worth carving out, then describe each at DRAFT depth: enough context to stand on its own and be picked up later, never a file-level plan.

Make the breakdown autonomously. Do NOT ask the author what to split or how — read the Meta Issue and decide. Keep the split deliberately small: group the work into the fewest sensible packages rather than many tiny ones, and never let the breakdown sprawl. Where the Meta Issue already implies an order or dependencies — a foundation package others build on, numbered tiers, lettered workstreams — preserve that structure rather than inventing your own, and key the Sub Issues so that order is clear.

## Hard non-goals — do NOT do any of these
- No file-level affected-areas breakdown.
- No step-by-step implementation design.
- No acceptance criteria grounded in concrete files, symbols, or functions.
- No naming of specific source files or functions, and no codebase analysis for a plan.

Each Sub Issue is a draft, not a plan. Turning a Sub Issue into a file-level engineering plan is the job of the separate elaborate and implement commands, run per Sub Issue when the author is ready. If you catch yourself writing acceptance criteria, an affected-areas list, or implementation steps, stop — that belongs to a later step.

- A short, stable key that encodes any implied order — "a", "b", "c" for lettered workstreams; "tier-1", "tier-2" for numbered tiers; "foundation" for a package others build on. Keys are lowercase, hyphenated, and unique.
- A descriptive, specific title — imperative mood, no severity or priority prefix.
- A Description: a few short paragraphs framing this work package and what it delivers, in plain terms a maintainer can pick up. Draft depth only.
- A Motivation: why this package matters and what depends on it.
- A rough Scope: exactly one of Small, Medium, or Large.

## Syncing the Meta Issue body

Return the Meta Issue body in "metaBody", edited ONLY to mark where each Sub Issue reference belongs:
- Reproduce the body VERBATIM. Change nothing except inserting placeholder tokens.
- Where the body carries a work-package list or section — a checkbox list, numbered tiers, lettered workstreams — insert the token {{sub:KEY}} on the existing line for that package, using the matching Sub Issue key. The runner replaces each token with the created issue's #number so the prose and the sub-issue list agree.
- Insert ONE token per work-package line, and only on lines that already describe a package. Do not add, remove, reorder, or reword any line.
- If the body carries no such list, return it UNCHANGED with no tokens.
- Every {{sub:KEY}} you insert MUST use a key you declared in "subIssues".
