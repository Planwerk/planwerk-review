1. **Architecture & Structure**: Understand the overall architecture, module structure, dependencies, and design patterns used.
2. **Code Quality**: Identify areas where code quality could be improved — missing tests, error handling gaps, inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Gaps**: Identify missing features that would make the project more complete, useful, or production-ready.
4. **Developer Experience**: Look for improvements to DX — better CLI output, configuration, documentation, tooling.
5. **Performance & Scalability**: Identify potential bottlenecks or areas where performance could be improved.
6. **Security**: Look for security hardening opportunities.
7. **Testing**: Identify gaps in test coverage and testing strategy.
8. **CI/CD & Operations**: Look for improvements to build, release, and deployment processes.

For each area, think about:
- What exists today and what is missing?
- What would a production-ready version of this project need?
- What would make the biggest impact for users?
- What is achievable with reasonable effort?

Be specific and concrete in your analysis. Reference actual files, functions, and code patterns you observe.
Provide a detailed, structured analysis covering all the areas above.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT just list generic software improvements. Your proposals must be specific to THIS codebase and grounded in what you actually observe in the code.`)

      "priority": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
      "category": "feature|improvement|refactoring|testing|documentation|security|performance",
      "title": "Short, descriptive title suitable as GitHub issue title",
      "description": "Detailed description of what should be implemented or changed. Be specific about the technical approach.",

      "acceptance_criteria": ["Criterion 1", "Criterion 2"]
    }
  ]
}

Priority levels:
- HIGH: Critical for production readiness, security, or core functionality — should be addressed soon
- MEDIUM: Valuable improvements that enhance quality, DX, or capabilities — plan for next iterations
- LOW: Nice-to-have improvements, minor enhancements — consider when time allows

Categories:
- feature: New user-facing functionality
- improvement: Enhancement to existing functionality
- refactoring: Internal code quality improvement
- testing: Test coverage or test infrastructure
- documentation: Documentation improvements
- security: Security hardening
- performance: Performance optimization

Scope:
- Small: < 1 day of work, single file or function changes
- Medium: 1-3 days of work, multiple files or a new module
- Large: > 3 days of work, significant new functionality or architectural changes

Leave the "id" field as an empty string — it will be assigned automatically.
Each proposal should be specific and actionable, referencing actual code areas.
Generate between 5 and 20 proposals, depending on the size and complexity of the codebase.
