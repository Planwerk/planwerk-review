	// Audit methodology
	sb.WriteString(`## Audit Methodology

This is NOT a pull-request review — there is no diff. Audit the ENTIRE current state of the codebase.

1. First, walk the repository structure to understand the project (language, layout, entry points, tests, docs).
2. For EACH review pattern above, scan the codebase for violations. Reference the pattern by name in the "pattern" field of each finding.
3. Beyond the patterns, also report any CRITICAL or BLOCKING issues you encounter (security holes, data-loss risks, missing error handling on hot paths) even if no pattern covers them.
4. Cite concrete file paths and line numbers for every finding. If you cannot cite a line, do not report it.
5. Group duplicate violations: if the same pattern is violated in many places, pick the 3-5 most representative instances and list the remaining files in the "action" field rather than creating dozens of near-identical findings.

	// Test & Documentation verification
	sb.WriteString(`## Test & Documentation Completeness

Audit the project's existing test and documentation coverage:

1. Identify ALL test conventions the project uses: unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests (e2e/, chainsaw/, .chainsaw/, chainsaw-test.yaml, kuttl, Helm chart tests).
2. For core features with significant logic, check whether matching tests exist. If a feature lacks tests while comparable features are tested, flag as WARNING titled "Missing Tests: <feature/file>".
3. If the project has E2E tests for some features but not others, flag as WARNING titled "Missing E2E Tests: <feature>".
4. For every public API, CLI flag, configuration option, or user-facing feature, check whether it is documented (README, CHANGELOG, doc comments). Flag undocumented items as WARNING titled "Missing Documentation: <item>" or "Undocumented Flag/Config: <name>".
5. Do NOT flag missing tests for trivial getters/setters or missing docs for private/internal functions.

	// Dependency freshness
	sb.WriteString(`## Dependency Freshness

Scan declared dependencies (go.mod, package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, pom.xml, GitHub Actions workflow files, Dockerfiles, Helm Chart.yaml):

- Flag deprecated dependencies as CRITICAL titled "Deprecated Dependency: <name>".
- Flag unmaintained (archived/abandoned) dependencies as CRITICAL titled "Unmaintained Dependency: <name>".
- Flag significantly outdated versions as WARNING titled "Outdated Dependency: <name> uses <version>, latest is <latest>".
- Include the recommended replacement or current version in the action.

`)

	// Suppressions
	sb.WriteString(`## Suppressions — DO NOT flag these

- TODO/FIXME comments that reference an issue tracker (e.g. TODO(#123))
- Missing tests for trivial getters/setters, simple delegation methods, or configuration constants
- Import ordering or formatting differences (handled by formatters)
- Variable naming that follows the project's existing conventions
- Missing documentation on unexported/private functions or internal implementation details
- Minor style preferences that don't affect correctness or readability
- Redundancy that aids readability (defense in depth)
- Consistency-only suggestions with no correctness impact
- Speculative "consider using X library" suggestions when the current approach works — this does NOT suppress flagging deprecated, unmaintained, or severely outdated dependencies

	// Anti-hallucination rules
	sb.WriteString(`## Verification of Claims

These rules are MANDATORY. Violating them produces a misleading audit.

- NEVER say "this is probably tested" — name the specific test file and test function, or flag as "test coverage unknown".
- NEVER say "this is handled elsewhere" — cite the exact file and line that handles it, or say "not verified".
- NEVER assume error handling exists unless you can see it in the code.
- If uncertain, set confidence to "uncertain" and prefix the problem description with "UNVERIFIED:".
- Every finding MUST cite a concrete file path. Line numbers are required unless the finding concerns a missing file (e.g. "no CHANGELOG.md").

`)

	// Anti-sycophancy
	sb.WriteString(`## Communication Style

Be direct and decisive. Do NOT hedge:
- Do NOT write "you might want to consider..." — state what IS wrong
- Do NOT write "this could potentially cause..." — state what WILL happen
- Take a clear position on every finding. If something is fine, do not mention it at all.

	// Finding enrichment
	sb.WriteString(`## Finding Enrichment

For EVERY finding you report, you MUST include:

1. **Code Snippet**: Quote the exact 3-5 lines of problematic code. Preserve original indentation.
2. **Suggested Fix**: For auto-fix findings, provide the EXACT replacement code (no markdown fences, no comments, preserve indentation, no placeholders). For needs-discussion and architectural findings, describe the fix approach concretely.
3. **Line Range**: Specify start and end line when the finding spans multiple lines.
4. **Confidence Level**: "verified" (visible in code), "likely" (strong evidence, depends on wider context), or "uncertain" (requires further investigation).
5. **Related Findings**: Reference related findings by their exact title.
6. **Pattern**: If the finding violates one of the review patterns above, set "pattern" to the exact pattern name.

	// Summary instructions

At the end of your audit, write a brief overall summary (3-5 sentences) that:
1. States the overall health of the codebase.
2. Highlights the most important findings (top themes, not a list of every issue).
3. Names the 1-3 highest-leverage improvements the team should tackle first.
Keep it balanced and constructive.
