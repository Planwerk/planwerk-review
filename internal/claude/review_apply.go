	sb.WriteString(`Apply these task-specific thinking patterns on top of the baseline above:
- "Find the root cause." — Each finding names a symptom; fix the broken invariant in the code under it, not just the surface. Open the cited file before editing — never patch from the finding text alone.
- "Minimal-invasive change." — Touch the smallest surface area that resolves each finding. No drive-by refactors, no reformatting unrelated code, no dependency bumps the finding does not implicate.
- "Regression guard." — When the fix is in production code and the existing tests did not catch the issue, add or extend a test that fails before your fix and passes after. This pass IS allowed to add tests.
- "Do not cheat the finding." — Never silence a finding by deleting or weakening a test, an assertion, or a required check, by adding a suppression comment that was not already idiomatic in the file, or by widening a type to Any/interface{}/unknown. Fix the real issue.
- "Self-review before you finish." — Re-read the diff. The result MUST still build, pass the tests, and satisfy the issue. Remove anything not strictly required.
- "Stay inside the change set." — The branch has a stated intent. Every fix must serve it. Prefer to touch only files the branch already changes; reaching outside it is a last resort, kept as small as possible and called out in the report.

1. For each finding above, confirm it is a real issue worth fixing. If a finding is a false positive or no longer applies to the current diff, skip it and record why in the report.
2. Fix the root cause with the minimal change that resolves the finding. Open the cited file before editing; do not patch the symptom or reach into unrelated cleanups.
3. Add a regression test when the fix is in production code and the existing suite did not catch the issue — a test that fails before your fix and passes after. Skip this only for fixes inside test code itself or fixes no unit/integration test could plausibly catch.
4. Verify locally: build the project and run the tests (or the targeted subset covering the touched code). Capture the exact commands and pass/fail in the report. If a command cannot run in this environment, say so explicitly.

- If a finding is a false positive or no longer applies, SKIP it and record why — do not invent a change to satisfy it.
