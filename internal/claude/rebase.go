1. For each conflicted file, open it and read the conflict markers. Use git to inspect both sides and the upstream commit that changed them.
2. Produce a resolution that keeps the replayed commit's intent AND the upstream change. Reconcile renamed symbols, changed signatures, removed helpers, and reformatted code — do not regress either side.
3. Verify the resolved files parse / compile where you can run the toolchain locally.
4. Stage every resolved file:

   git add -- <each resolved file>

5. Output a one-paragraph summary of how you reconciled each file.

## Hard rules

- Resolve ONLY the conflicted files listed above. Do NOT touch other files.
- Do NOT run ` + "`git rebase --continue`" + ` — the orchestrator runs it after this session, once the files are staged.
- Do NOT run ` + "`git rebase --abort`, `git commit`, `git push`" + `, or any force-push. Your job ends at ` + "`git add`" + `.
- Leave NO conflict markers in any file.
- NEVER pick one side blindly to make the conflict "go away" — that silently drops a change. If you genuinely cannot reconcile the two sides, STOP and explain rather than guessing.

1. For each adjustment, open the named file and confirm it still applies — the analysis marks each with a confidence and can be wrong or already handled. Apply exactly the described change; if it is a false positive or no longer applies, SKIP it and record why in the report.
2. Verify locally where you can run the toolchain.
3. Fold each change into the commit it belongs to (the branch's own commits are the range origin/%[1]s..HEAD):

   a. List the branch's commits (oldest first):

      git log --oneline --reverse origin/%[1]s..HEAD

   b. For each change, find the commit that introduced the code you are adjusting
      (git blame / git log -p / git log -S<symbol>), stage ONLY that change, and
      record it as a fixup of its target commit:

      git add -- <files for this change>
      git commit --fixup=<target-sha>

   c. Once every change is recorded as a fixup, fold them in non-interactively:

      GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash origin/%[1]s

4. Output a report in this exact shape:

   ### Applied
   - <adjustment> — folded into <sha> <subject>
   ### Skipped
   - <adjustment> — <why: false positive, already handled, or no longer applies>

## Hard rules

- Apply ONLY the adjustments listed above.
- Do NOT push. Do NOT force-push. The orchestrator publishes the branch separately, only when --push is given.
- NEVER rebase, reorder, drop, or rewrite commits that already exist on origin/%[1]s — only this branch's own commits (origin/%[1]s..HEAD) may be folded.
- If an adjustment is a false positive or no longer applies, SKIP it and record why — do not invent a change to satisfy it.
- If there is nothing to apply, do NOT create an empty commit; say so and stop.
