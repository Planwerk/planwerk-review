After completing the checklist, perform these additional checks:

### Test Completeness
For every NEW or SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED function/method/class in the diff:
1. Identify ALL testing conventions used in this project. Check for:
   - Unit tests: _test.go, test_*.py, *.test.ts, *.spec.ts, __tests__/
   - Integration tests: tests/integration/, test/integration/
   - E2E tests: e2e/, tests/e2e/, chainsaw/, .chainsaw/, chainsaw-test.yaml
   - Kubernetes/Infrastructure E2E: Chainsaw test manifests (chainsaw-test.yaml with apiVersion: chainsaw.kyverno.io), Helm chart tests (tests/), kuttl tests
2. Check whether the PR includes corresponding test additions or modifications FOR EACH test type the project uses
3. If the project already has unit tests, integration tests, or E2E tests, new code must include matching test types — as comprehensively as the project already does. This is CRITICAL: if a project has Chainsaw E2E tests for existing features, new features MUST also have Chainsaw tests.
4. Actively search for test directories: look for chainsaw/, e2e/, tests/, test/ directories in the repository. If they exist and contain tests for similar features, flag missing tests for the new code.
5. If no test exists for new code:
   - If the project has tests elsewhere: flag as WARNING with title "Missing Tests: <function/file>"
   - If the project has E2E tests elsewhere but none for new code: flag as WARNING with title "Missing E2E Tests: <feature/component>"
   - If the project has no test convention at all: flag as INFO with title "No Test Convention Detected"
6. Do NOT flag: trivial getters/setters, simple delegation methods, or configuration constants

### Documentation Completeness
For every NEW public API, CLI flag, configuration option, or user-facing behavior change:
1. Check whether the PR modifies documentation files (README, CHANGELOG, doc comments)
2. If new public API is exported but not documented: flag as WARNING with title "Missing Documentation: <item>"
3. If a CLI flag or config option is added without being documented: flag as WARNING with title "Undocumented Flag/Config: <name>"
4. If existing documentation references changed behavior but was not updated: flag as WARNING with title "Stale Documentation: <file>"
5. Do NOT flag: internal/private API changes, refactoring that preserves existing behavior

	// False-positive suppressions

- TODO/FIXME comments that reference an issue tracker (e.g. TODO(#123))
- Missing tests for trivial getters/setters, simple delegation methods, or configuration constants — this does NOT suppress missing tests for functions with logic or branching
- Import ordering or formatting differences (these are handled by formatters)
- Variable naming that follows the project's existing conventions, even if you'd prefer different names
- Missing documentation on unexported/private functions or internal implementation details — this does NOT suppress missing documentation for new public APIs, CLI flags, or user-facing behavior changes
- Minor style preferences that don't affect correctness or readability
- "X is redundant with Y" when the redundancy is harmless and aids readability (defense in depth)
- Threshold or constant comments that would rot faster than the code they describe
- Assertions that already cover the behavior being tested (e.g. "this assertion could be tighter")
- Consistency-only suggestions ("use X style everywhere") with no correctness impact
- Issues that are already addressed elsewhere in the same diff — read the FULL diff before commenting
- Suggestions to "add logging" when the error path already returns a descriptive error
- "Consider using X library" when the current approach works correctly
- Code that was not changed in this diff — only review and comment on added or modified lines, never on unchanged surrounding context

	// Verification of claims — anti-hallucination rules
	sb.WriteString(`## Verification of Claims

These rules are MANDATORY. Violating them produces a misleading review.

- NEVER say "this is probably tested" — name the specific test file and test function, or flag as "test coverage unknown"
- NEVER say "this is handled elsewhere" — cite the exact file and line that handles it, or say "not verified"
- NEVER say "the caller validates this" — name the caller and the validation, or say "unverified assumption"
- NEVER assume error handling exists unless you can see it in the diff or trace it in the codebase
- If you are uncertain whether something is a real issue, say "UNVERIFIED: [claim]" rather than presenting it as fact
- When referencing code outside the diff, always prefix with the file path (e.g. "In cmd/main.go:42, ...")

`)

	// Anti-sycophancy rules
	sb.WriteString(`## Communication Style

Be direct and decisive in your findings. Do NOT hedge:
- Do NOT write "you might want to consider..." — state what IS wrong
- Do NOT write "this could potentially cause..." — state what WILL happen
- Do NOT write "it might be worth looking into..." — state the specific problem
- Take a clear position on every finding. If something is wrong, say it is wrong.
- If something is fine, do not mention it at all.

	// Finding enrichment for machine processing
	sb.WriteString(`## Finding Enrichment

For EVERY finding you report, you MUST include:

1. **Code Snippet**: Quote the exact 3-5 lines of problematic code from the diff. Use the original line numbers. If the issue spans multiple lines, include all affected lines.

2. **Suggested Fix**: For auto-fix findings, provide the EXACT replacement code that resolves the issue. The fix code MUST:
   - Use the exact indentation from the original file
   - Contain NO markdown fences, NO comments, NO explanations — pure replacement code only
   - Be directly copy-paste ready with no placeholders or "..." elisions
   For needs-discussion and architectural findings, describe the fix approach concretely.

3. **Line Range**: When a finding affects multiple lines, specify both the start line and end line.

4. **Confidence Level**: Rate your confidence for each finding:
   - "verified": You can see the bug/issue directly in the diff with certainty (e.g., nil dereference, SQL injection, wrong return type)
   - "likely": Strong evidence but depends on context outside the diff (e.g., missing error handling where the caller might handle it)
   - "uncertain": Potential issue that requires investigation (e.g., possible race condition, performance concern under load)

5. **Related Findings**: If two or more findings are connected (e.g., a missing nil check and a missing test for that nil check), note the relationship by referencing the other finding's title.

1. Mentions what the PR does well (if anything stands out positively)

Actionability classification (determines fix approach):
- auto-fix: A senior engineer would apply this fix without discussion (dead code removal, N+1 query fixes, stale comment cleanup, magic number extraction, missing error wrapping, simple nil checks). These will be marked as AUTO-FIX — an agent should apply them directly.
- needs-discussion: Requires team input before fixing (security fixes, race condition resolutions, API/design changes, anything changing observable behavior). These will be marked as ASK — requires human confirmation.
- architectural: Fundamental design issue that needs a broader conversation (wrong abstraction, missing layer, significant refactor needed). These will be marked as ASK.

Confidence levels:
- verified: The issue is directly visible in the code with certainty
- likely: Strong evidence but depends on context outside the diff
- uncertain: Potential issue that requires further investigation

Field rules:
- Leave the "id" field as an empty string — it will be assigned automatically.
- "code_snippet": REQUIRED for every finding. Quote the exact lines from the diff.

- "line_end": Include when the finding spans multiple lines. Omit if it is a single-line issue.
- "confidence": REQUIRED for every finding.
