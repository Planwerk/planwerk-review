// This file holds prompt building blocks that are shared across more than one
// prompt builder. Keeping them in one place stops the copies from drifting
// (the failure mode that motivated extracting them): before this, the audit
// prompt carried a shortened Suppressions list and the adversarial and
// compliance prompts had no anti-hedging discipline at all.
//
// Blocks that carry intentional, builder-specific variation (the Staff
// Engineer persona, Verification of Claims, and Finding Enrichment differ
// between a diff review and a whole-codebase audit) are deliberately NOT
// shared here — forcing them into one shape would inject diff-only wording
// into the codebase audit and vice versa.
//
// The July 2026 audit batch (issue #159) added the following blocks, each
// byte-identical across its callers before extraction:
//   - findingBudgetBlock — the "## Finding Budget" section (review, audit); it
//     folds in the MaxFindings > 0 guard, returning "" when no budget is set.
//   - workBreakdownDefinition — the work-breakdown enumeration (implement,
//     bare-implement, verify-implementation, plan); each caller keeps its own
//     surrounding sentence.
//   - draftHardNonGoalsBlock, draftTitleLine, draftScopeLine, draftSchemaRules —
//     the draft-depth scaffolding shared by the draft and meta prompts.
//   - diffScopeLines — the "SCOPE: … / git diff --name-only" lead (adversarial,
//     compliance, simplify-find, specialist).
//   - emptyIDLine — the "leave id empty" line (propose, gap-analysis,
//     review-prepared structuring).
//   - simplifyGuardrailBullets, selfReviewPatternLine — the simplify guardrail
//     bullets and the self-review pattern shared by the simplify and review-apply
//     prompts.
//   - fixThinkingPatterns — the fix thinking-pattern block (fix, bare-fix).
//
// A few near-copies stay per-builder on purpose and are NOT shared here:
//   - The fifth simplify-guardrail bullet differs between the find and apply
//     passes; unifying it would change what the apply pass is asked to do, so it
//     stays per-pass (that class of change is issue #158's, not an audit edit).
//   - The coverage prompt has no SCOPE sentence — it shares only the
//     "git diff --name-only" command line, keeps its own task lead, and so does
//     not call diffScopeLines.
//   - The "Then …" line after the scope lead differs per builder and stays
//     inline at each call site.
//   - The structure prompt carries a fourth copy of the id line; the structure
//     prompts are rewritten by issue #157, so that copy is left untouched here.
//   - The bare-draft prompt keeps its own condensed hard-non-goals wording.

// promptScope distinguishes a diff-scoped review (a PR or branch comparison)
// from a whole-codebase audit. It selects the scope-specific suppression
// bullets so a single source can serve both without leaking diff-only wording
// into the codebase audit.

- Be concrete: name the actual behavior, component, file, or change — not "improve the system" or "various aspects". This rule is subordinate to accuracy: NEVER invent a specific (a file path, symbol, or number) just to sound concrete. When a specific is genuinely unknown, mark it as an assumption rather than fabricating it.
- Active voice, present tense. Short, common words ("use", not "utilize"). One idea per paragraph, topic sentence first.
- Cut ruthlessly. Delete throat-clearing openers ("It should be noted that", "It is worth noting that", "In other words", "This contributes by"). If a sentence adds nothing, remove it.
- ` + bannedVocabularyLine() + `
- Vary sentence length. Do not dress up your own work with adjectives ("critical fix", "powerful feature"). Write "This change…", not a bare "This…".

When you reason about architecture, use this one vocabulary so every plan, analysis, and audit speaks the same terms:

- **module** — a unit of code whose implementation is hidden behind an interface (a package, type, or function).
- **interface** — the surface a module exposes to its callers: its signatures, contracts, and documented behavior, not its internals.
- **depth** — a module's functionality measured against the size of its interface. A deep module hides much behind a small interface; a shallow module's interface is nearly as large as its implementation.
- **seam** — a place where one implementation can be substituted for another (a point of variation), not every call site.
- **adapter** — the implementation that translates across a seam to an external system.
- **leverage** — the functionality a module provides relative to the interface a caller must learn; a deep module offers high leverage. (Used as a noun only.)
- **locality** — keeping the knowledge needed to understand or change a behavior in one place rather than spread across modules.

Use these exact terms. Do NOT substitute the looser words "component", "service", or "boundary" for module, interface, or seam — they blur the distinction this vocabulary exists to keep. ("System boundary" and "trust boundary" remain fine; the prohibition is only on using "boundary" where you mean a seam or an interface.)

- "Minimal-invasive change." — Touch the smallest surface area that resolves each failure. No drive-by refactors, no reformatting unrelated code, no dependency bumps that are not directly implicated.
- "Regression guard." — If the broken behavior is in production code and existing tests did not catch it, extend or add a test that fails before your fix and passes after.
- "Simplify the diff." — Re-read your own diff and remove anything not strictly required. Prefer fewer lines, fewer files, fewer abstractions.
- "Self-review before committing." — Walk through the diff once more as the reviewer. Reject anything you would push back on.
- "Stay inside the PR." — The PR has a stated intent (title + body). Your fix must serve it. Prefer to touch only files the PR already changes; reaching outside it is a last resort — do it ONLY when the failing check cannot be fixed any other way, keep that reach as small as possible, and never reach outside for unrelated cleanups.
