// Capture runs the read-only knowledge-proposal pass for a cloned repo after the
// implement review pass. It makes two Claude calls:
//  1. Mine the review findings for generalizable review patterns and the plan +
//     implementation report for durable memory pages, deduplicating each
//     candidate against the existing wiki entries and the pattern catalog, in
//     unstructured prose.
//  2. Structure that prose into JSON matching capture.CaptureResult.
//
// The proposal pass is read-only — runClaude denies the write tools at the
// harness level — so Claude authors candidate page bytes but can never push them
// or mutate the checkout. Whether any page is written to the wiki is decided
// later, in the gated write-back (#139). MarkUpdates labels each proposal that
// re-proposes an existing wiki path so a re-run updates rather than appends.

An implement run produces three rich sources of knowledge worth keeping: the review findings (the bugs the review pass caught), the implementation plan, and the implementation report (the decisions, trade-offs, and deviations the work surfaced). Your job is to mine them for two kinds of durable, reusable knowledge — and to propose it WITHOUT writing anything.

	sb.WriteString(`## What to propose

- **review patterns** — a generalizable, RECURRING review rule, drawn from the review findings. Propose a pattern ONLY when the finding names a class of mistake that will recur across this codebase and that a future reviewer should check for — not a one-off bug, not a project-specific typo, not a change already covered by an existing pattern. The bar is high: a pattern earns its place only if it is reusable knowledge, not a record of this single fix.
- **memory pages** — a durable design decision, convention, or rationale, drawn from the plan and the implementation report. One page per decision: the "why" behind a non-obvious choice, a constraint the team must honor, a trade-off that was weighed. Skip anything already obvious from the code or already recorded in the wiki.

## The quality bar

If you cannot name the broader class of mistake a candidate pattern guards against, it is not a pattern — drop it.

This is a READ-ONLY proposal pass. NEVER edit, create, move, or delete any file in the checkout or the wiki. You author candidate page bodies as text in your answer; a separate, gated step decides whether any of them is ever written.

## Deduplicate against what already exists

Every candidate MUST be checked against the existing wiki entries AND the pattern catalog below, so capture never manufactures redundancy:

- If a candidate pattern duplicates or is already covered by an existing wiki review pattern or a catalog pattern, DROP it.
- If a candidate memory page restates an existing memory entry, DROP it.
- If a durable decision belongs in an EXISTING memory page, propose an UPDATE to that page: reuse its exact wiki path and author the revised full-page body. Otherwise give a new page a fresh, descriptive kebab-case slug.

## Page conventions

- A review pattern's body MUST follow the catalog format exactly: a "# Review Pattern: <name>" header, then the "**Review-Area**:", "**Detection-Hint**:", "**Severity**:", "**Category**:", "**Applies-When**:", and "**Sources**:" metadata lines, then a "## What to check" section and a "## Why it matters" section.
- A memory page's body is free-form Markdown: one durable decision, stated plainly.
- Use a stable, descriptive kebab-case slug in the path (e.g. "review_patterns/escape-untrusted-fences.md", "memory/capture-is-propose-only.md") so a re-run that re-proposes the same knowledge updates the page rather than appending a new one. Do NOT add any provenance marker or timestamp to the body — that is stamped on later.
