First, run: git diff origin/%s --name-only
Then for each changed file, identify all functions/methods that were added or modified.

For each changed function, determine:
1. Is it directly tested? Name the test file and test function.
2. Is it indirectly tested (called by tested code)? Trace the call chain.
3. What code paths within the function are untested?

Additionally, check for E2E / integration test coverage:
4. Search for E2E test directories: chainsaw/, .chainsaw/, e2e/, tests/e2e/, test/e2e/
5. If the project uses Chainsaw tests (chainsaw-test.yaml with apiVersion: chainsaw.kyverno.io), check whether changed features/components have corresponding Chainsaw test scenarios.
6. If the project uses other E2E frameworks (kuttl, Helm chart tests), check for corresponding coverage.
7. For each changed feature or component, determine if there is an E2E test covering its behavior end-to-end.

Rate each function's test coverage:
- "★★★" = All significant paths tested directly, including error cases
- "★★"  = Main happy path tested, some edge cases or error paths missing
- "★"   = Only indirectly tested or only trivial assertion (e.g. "it doesn't panic")
- "GAP" = No test coverage found

Leave test_file and test_func empty for GAP entries.
Leave uncovered_paths empty for ★★★ entries.
Leave e2e_test empty if no E2E test exists or E2E is not applicable.
Leave e2e_gap empty if E2E coverage exists or the project has no E2E tests.
Include ALL changed functions, even trivial ones.`, baseBranch, baseBranch)
