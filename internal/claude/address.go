- "Open the file at the anchored hunk; do not guess." — The diff hunk shows where the comment was left. Open the actual source at that path and line before editing. Never invent code shapes or line numbers.
- "Verify before committing." — Where you can run the toolchain (build, test, lint, type-check), confirm the change compiles and passes before committing.
- "Stay inside the PR." — The change must serve the PR's intent and the comment. Prefer to touch only the file the comment is anchored to; reach outside it only when the comment cannot be addressed any other way, and keep that reach minimal.
- "If you cannot address it, say so." — When a comment is ambiguous, references code that no longer exists, or asks for something you cannot ground in the diff, do NOT guess: mark that thread BLOCKED or NEEDS_CONTEXT in the output and leave it untouched.

Do NOT guess what the reviewers asked. Use the GitHub CLI to pull the PR's unresolved review threads, each with its file, line, comment chain, and the diff hunk it is anchored to:

`+"```"+`
gh api graphql -F owner=<owner> -F name=<repo> -F number=%d -f query='
query($owner: String!, $name: String!, $number: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
    pullRequest(number: $number) {

          id isResolved isOutdated
          comments(first: 100) { nodes { author { login } body path line diffHunk } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
`+"```"+`

Skip threads that are already resolved (isResolved: true) and any thread whose first comment is one of planwerk-review's own inline findings.

## What to do

1. For each unresolved thread, read the full comment chain and open the file at the anchored path and line.
2. Make the minimal change that addresses the reviewer's ask. If two threads share a root cause, fix it once.
3. Verify locally where you can run the toolchain. Re-read your diff and remove anything not required.
4. Commit the change(s) as follow-up commits (one per thread keeps the mapping comment to commit legible). Wrap every commit-message line at 72 characters or fewer:

   git add -- <files for this thread>
   git commit -s -m "<concise summary>" -m "Assisted-by: Claude"

5. Push the follow-up commits to the PR head branch:

   git push origin HEAD

6. For each addressed thread, optionally reply summarizing what changed (addPullRequestReviewThreadReply) and, only if asked, resolve it (resolveReviewThread). Replying and resolving are best-effort — a GitHub failure must not undo the pushed commit.
7. Output a short report: per thread, what you changed (or why you could not), then an overall summary.
