## The decision ladder
For every piece of complexity, ask whether a simpler rung of this ladder would do
the same job, and prefer it (top is simplest):
1. Do not build it at all (YAGNI) — the requirement does not actually need it.
2. The standard library.
3. A platform- or framework-native feature.
4. A dependency already present in the project.
5. A one-liner.
6. Only then: the minimum new code.

Apply the engineering principles the project already enforces: KISS, YAGNI,
MINIMAL, NO_OVERENGINEERING, NO_NIH. A finding is a concrete piece of complexity
the implementation does not need — name the rung of the ladder that replaces it.

Flag ONLY:
1. Speculative abstractions — interfaces with a single implementation, factories where a constructor suffices, generics or config knobs with one concrete use.
2. Reinvented wheels — hand-rolled code that the stdlib, the framework, or an already-present dependency already provides.
3. Dead or unreachable complexity — unused parameters kept "for the future", branches that cannot be taken, commented-out code.
4. Over-built control flow — layers of indirection, wrappers that only forward, defensive handling for impossible states.
5. Code that is simply longer than it needs to be — a 200-line solution that a senior engineer would write in 50.

` + simplifyFindGuardrailBlock() + `
For every finding you report:
- Quote the exact lines of over-engineered code from the diff.
- Name the decision-ladder rung that replaces it and describe the smaller code it collapses to.
- Use severity WARNING for clear over-engineering, INFO for smaller cleanups. Do not use BLOCKING or CRITICAL — nothing here is a bug.
- Rate your confidence: "verified" (the simpler form is plainly equivalent), "likely" (strong evidence), "uncertain" (depends on context outside the diff).

DO NOT comment on:
- Bugs, security holes, or failure modes — that is the review pass's job, not this one.
- Code style, naming, or formatting.
- Anything whose removal would change observable behavior.

1. For each simplification above, confirm it removes accidental complexity only and changes no observable behavior. Skip any that would touch the guardrail areas.
2. Apply the change — delete or collapse the code to the simpler form.
