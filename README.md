# planwerk-review

AI-powered code review and codebase analysis tool for GitHub repositories. Uses Claude CLI to automatically analyze PR changes and produce structured review results, to analyze entire repositories and generate actionable feature proposals, or to audit an entire codebase against all known review patterns.

```

### Review Workflow

1. **PR Input**: The tool receives a GitHub PR as input (URL or `owner/repo#number`).
2. **Checkout**: The PR is checked out locally (diff between base and head). PR title and description are fetched for scope analysis.
3. **Load Review Patterns**: Patterns are loaded from two sources:
   - `patterns/` in the planwerk-review repository (general patterns)
   - `.planwerk/review_patterns/` in the target repository (repo-specific patterns)
4. **Claude CLI Review**: `claude /review` is executed with a structured prompt that includes persona framing, scope analysis, a two-pass checklist, suppression rules, and review patterns.
5. **Result Aggregation**: Review results are collected, deduplicated, categorized by severity, and classified by actionability. Findings are enriched with code snippets, suggested fixes, confidence levels, and cross-references.
6. **Output**: A structured report is written to `stdout`, optionally posted as a PR comment (`--post-review`), or posted as inline review comments on the PR diff (`--inline`).

### Review Methodology

The review prompt uses techniques inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) to maximize review quality:

#### Staff Engineer Persona

Claude is instructed to review as a Staff Engineer, applying specific cognitive patterns:
- *"What happens at 10x scale?"* — Load, data volume, concurrent users
- *"What's the blast radius?"* — If this code fails, what else breaks?
- *"What happens at 3am?"* — Error paths, oncall clarity, log quality
- *"Would a new team member understand this?"* — Code clarity and intent
- *"Where are the tests?"* — Does every new behavior have a test?
- *"Would I find this in the docs?"* — Is this feature discoverable from documentation?

#### Scope Drift Detection

Before reviewing code quality, the tool checks for:
- **Scope Creep**: Files changed that are unrelated to the PR title/description
- **Missing Requirements**: Requirements from the PR description not addressed in the diff

#### Three-Pass Review Checklist

Claude works through a structured checklist in three passes:

| Pass | Focus | Categories |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Pass 1 — Critical** | Always checked | SQL & Data Safety, Race Conditions, Error Handling, Security, Input Validation, LLM Output Trust, Crypto |
| **Pass 2 — Semantic** | Requires tracing beyond the diff | Enum Completeness, Conditional Side Effects, Type Coercion, Test Coverage for New Code, Documentation Completeness |
| **Pass 3 — Informational** | Checked if time permits | Magic Numbers, Dead Code, Test Quality, Performance, API Contract, View/Frontend, Time Window |

#### Suppressions

To reduce false positives, the following are explicitly suppressed:
- TODO/FIXME comments with issue tracker references
- Missing tests for trivial getters/setters (does not suppress missing tests for functions with logic)
- Import ordering or formatting differences
- Variable naming matching existing project conventions
- Missing documentation on private functions (does not suppress missing docs for public APIs)
- Minor style preferences
- Code that was not changed in the diff (only added or modified lines are reviewed)

#### Test & Documentation Verification

After the checklist passes, the review explicitly verifies:
- **Test Completeness**: Every new or significantly modified function should have corresponding tests matching the project's testing conventions. The tool actively searches for all test categories: unit tests (`_test.go`, `test_*.py`, `*.spec.ts`), integration tests (`tests/integration/`), and E2E tests (`e2e/`, `chainsaw/`, `.chainsaw/`, `chainsaw-test.yaml`, kuttl). If the project uses multiple test types, new code must include matching tests for each category. Missing E2E tests are flagged separately from missing unit tests.
- **Documentation Completeness**: New public APIs, CLI flags, configuration options, and user-facing behavior changes must be reflected in documentation (README, CHANGELOG, doc comments).
- **New File Detection**: Newly added source files are flagged as candidates for documentation if they are not test files or internal configuration. Test file detection covers language-based conventions as well as infrastructure test patterns (Chainsaw, E2E directories).

#### Anti-Sycophancy Rules

Claude is instructed to be direct and decisive — no hedging with phrases like "you might want to consider" or "this could potentially cause". Every finding takes a clear position.

#### Actionability Classification

Each finding is classified by actionability:

| Classification | Meaning | Examples |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| **auto-fix** | A senior engineer would apply without discussion | Dead code, magic numbers, missing error wrapping |
| **needs-discussion** | Requires team input before fixing | Security decisions, API changes, behavioral changes |
| **architectural** | Needs a broader design conversation | Wrong abstraction, missing layer, significant refactor |

### Propose Workflow

1. **Repo Input**: The tool receives a GitHub repository reference (URL or `owner/repo`).
2. **Clone**: The repository is cloned locally with a partial clone filter.
3. **Cache Check**: The default branch HEAD SHA is fetched via `git ls-remote`. If a cached result exists for this SHA, it is reused.
4. **Claude Analysis**: Claude performs a deep codebase analysis covering architecture, code quality, feature gaps, DX, performance, security, testing, and CI/CD.
5. **Structuring**: A second Claude call converts the raw analysis into structured JSON proposals with priority, category, scope, and acceptance criteria.
6. **Output**: Proposals are rendered as Markdown (default), JSON, or GitHub issue templates.
7. **Interactive Issue Creation** (optional): With `--create-issues`, the user is shown a summary table and walked through each proposal with a prompt to create a GitHub issue via `gh`.

### Audit Workflow

1. **Repo Input**: The tool receives a GitHub repository reference (URL or `owner/repo`).
2. **Clone**: The repository is cloned locally with a partial clone filter.
3. **Cache Check**: The default branch HEAD SHA is fetched via `git ls-remote`. If a cached result exists for this SHA and set of flags, it is reused.
4. **Technology Detection**: The clone is scanned for language/framework markers (Go, Python, Kubernetes, Helm, GitHub Actions, …) and patterns are filtered to those applicable.
5. **Pattern Load**: Patterns are loaded from `patterns/` (general) and `.planwerk/review_patterns/` (repo-specific) — identical sources to the review command.
6. **Claude Audit**: Claude is instructed to apply EVERY loaded pattern to the ENTIRE current state of the codebase (not a diff) and emit concrete violations with file paths, line numbers, code snippets, and suggested fixes. Beyond patterns, it also flags BLOCKING/CRITICAL issues it encounters (security, data loss, broken error handling) and missing tests/docs matching the project's own conventions.
7. **Structuring**: A second Claude call converts the raw findings into the same structured JSON format used by the review command (`BLOCKING`/`CRITICAL`/`WARNING`/`INFO` with fix class, confidence, related findings).
8. **Output**: Findings are rendered as Markdown (default) or JSON, with an audit-specific verdict line (`Action required` / `Improvements suggested` / `Codebase healthy`) instead of the PR merge verdict.

### CLI Interface

#### Review (default command)

```bash
# Simple invocation with PR URL
planwerk-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Short form with owner/repo#number
planwerk-review owner/repo#123

# With explicit pattern directory
planwerk-review --patterns ./custom-patterns owner/repo#123

# Only output specific severity levels
planwerk-review --min-severity warning owner/repo#123

# Post review as inline comments on the PR
planwerk-review --inline owner/repo#123

# Write output to file
planwerk-review owner/repo#123 > review.md
```

##### Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--patterns` | Additional pattern directory | - |
| `--min-severity` | Minimum severity level for output (`info`, `warning`, `critical`, `blocking`) | `info` |
| `--no-repo-patterns` | Ignore repo-specific patterns | `false` |
| `--no-local-patterns` | Ignore local patterns from the tool | `false` |
| `--no-cache` | Ignore cache, force a fresh review | `false` |
| `--clear-cache` | Clear all cached reviews and exit | `false` |
| `--format` | Output format (`markdown`, `json`) | `markdown` |
| `--post-review` | Post review as a comment on the PR (updates existing if found) | `false` |
| `--inline` | Post review with inline comments using GitHub Review API (implies `--post-review`) | `false` |
| `--thorough` | Run additional adversarial review pass for security and failure modes | `false` |
| `--coverage-map` | Generate test coverage map for changed functions | `false` |
| `--max-patterns` | Max review patterns injected into the prompt (`<=0` disables truncation; overridable via `PLANWERK_MAX_PATTERNS`) | `50` |

##### Global Flags

These flags apply to every `planwerk-review` command (`review`, `propose`, `audit`):

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Enable debug-level logging (also shows verbose build info with `--version`) | `false` |
| `--log-format` | Log output format: `text` (human-friendly, default) or `json` (one JSON object per record, CI-friendly) | `text` |

Logs are written to stderr; when stderr is not a terminal, Claude-invocation heartbeats are still emitted at INFO level so long-running runs are visible in CI log streams.

#### Propose (subcommand)

```bash
# Analyze a repository and generate feature proposals
planwerk-review propose https://github.com/owner/repo

# Short form
planwerk-review propose owner/repo

# Output as JSON
planwerk-review propose --format json owner/repo

# Output as GitHub issue templates
planwerk-review propose --format issues owner/repo

# Force fresh analysis (ignore cache)
planwerk-review propose --no-cache owner/repo

# Interactively create GitHub issues from proposals
planwerk-review propose --create-issues owner/repo

# Write proposals to file
planwerk-review propose owner/repo > proposals.md
```

##### Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--no-cache` | Ignore cache, force a fresh analysis | `false` |
| `--format` | Output format (`markdown`, `json`, `issues`) | `markdown` |
| `--create-issues` | Interactively create GitHub issues from proposals | `false` |

#### Audit (subcommand)

```bash
# Apply all loaded review patterns to an entire codebase
planwerk-review audit https://github.com/owner/repo

# Short form
planwerk-review audit owner/repo

# Only output findings at or above a severity threshold
planwerk-review audit --min-severity warning owner/repo

# JSON output for tooling
planwerk-review audit --format json owner/repo

# Force fresh audit (ignore cache)
planwerk-review audit --no-cache owner/repo

# Cap the number of findings Claude returns
planwerk-review audit --max-findings 25 owner/repo

# Write findings to file
planwerk-review audit owner/repo > audit.md
```

##### Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--patterns` | Additional pattern directory | - |
| `--min-severity` | Minimum severity level for output (`info`, `warning`, `critical`, `blocking`) | `info` |
| `--no-repo-patterns` | Ignore repo-specific patterns | `false` |
| `--no-local-patterns` | Ignore local patterns from the tool | `false` |
| `--no-cache` | Ignore cache, force a fresh audit | `false` |
| `--format` | Output format (`markdown`, `json`) | `markdown` |
| `--max-patterns` | Max review patterns injected into the prompt (`<=0` disables truncation; overridable via `PLANWERK_MAX_PATTERNS`) | `50` |
| `--max-findings` | Cap on findings returned (`<=0` disables cap) | `0` |

### Shell Completions & Man Pages

Completions for `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, and `powershell` are emitted via Cobra's built-in `completion` subcommand:

```bash
# Load completions for the current shell session (bash)
source <(planwerk-review completion bash)

# Install persistently (zsh, Homebrew example)
planwerk-review completion zsh > "$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_planwerk-review"

# Fish
planwerk-review completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/planwerk-review.fish
```

When installed from Homebrew, deb, or rpm packages, completions and man pages (`man planwerk-review`) are installed automatically. Packages are produced by `goreleaser` — see `.goreleaser.yml`.

For local development, regenerate the artifacts into `completions/` and `docs/man/`:

```bash
make completions
make man
```

### Output Format

The generated Markdown report follows a fixed structure:

```markdown
# Review: owner/repo#123

> *Feature: Add user authentication*
> Reviewed by planwerk-review vX.Y.Z with Claude CLI

<!-- planwerk-review: blocking=1 critical=2 warning=3 info=1 recommendation=HOLD -->

## BLOCKING (1)

### B-001: Hardcoded secrets in configuration
**File**: `config/auth.go:42` — **Fix**: ASK — **Confidence**: verified — **Pattern**: Hardcoded values

**Problem**: API secret is hardcoded directly in the source code.

**Action Required**: Remove secret from code and provide it via
environment variable or secret manager.

---

## CRITICAL (2)

### C-001: SQL Injection in User Query
**File**: `db/users.go:87-92` — **Fix**: ASK — **Confidence**: verified

**Problem**: User input is used in SQL query without sanitization.

**Action Required**: Use prepared statements.

---

### C-002: Missing error handling
**File**: `handlers/login.go:23` — **Fix**: AUTO-FIX — **Confidence**: likely

**Problem**: Error from `ValidateToken()` is ignored.

**Action Required**: Check error and return HTTP 401 on failure.

**Related**: B-001

---

## WARNING (3)

### W-001: ...

---

## Summary

The PR introduces user authentication with a well-structured handler layer, but hardcoded secrets and an SQL injection vulnerability must be addressed before merge. Error handling is inconsistent across the new endpoints.

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| BLOCKING | 1     |
| CRITICAL | 2     |
| WARNING  | 3     |
| INFO     | 1     |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not merge** — 1 BLOCKING and 2 CRITICAL findings must be resolved first.
```

#### Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **BLOCKING** | Fundamental architecture/security issues | PR must not be merged |
| **CRITICAL** | Bugs, security vulnerabilities, severe problems | Must be fixed before merge |
| **WARNING** | Code quality, potential issues | Should be fixed |
| **INFO** | Style questions, improvement suggestions | Optional, for information |

#### Actionability Levels

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **auto-fix** | A senior engineer would fix without discussion | Apply the suggested fix directly |
| **needs-discussion** | Requires team input before fixing | Discuss in PR comments or team sync |
| **architectural** | Fundamental design issue | Needs broader design conversation |

#### Enriched Finding Fields

Each finding includes additional metadata for tooling and automation:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **FixClass** | `AUTO-FIX` or `ASK` — derived from Actionability, indicates whether the fix can be applied directly |
| **Confidence** | `verified`, `likely`, or `uncertain` — how certain the reviewer is about the finding |
| **CodeSnippet** | The relevant code fragment from the diff |
| **SuggestedFix** | Concrete replacement code for auto-fix findings |
| **RelatedTo** | IDs of related findings (e.g., `["B-001", "C-003"]`) |
| **LineEnd** | End line for multi-line findings (enables line-range comments) |

#### Machine-Readable Output

The Markdown report includes an HTML comment with counts and recommendation verdict for machine consumption:

```html
<!-- planwerk-review: blocking=1 critical=2 warning=0 info=3 recommendation=HOLD -->
```

Verdict values: `HOLD` (blockers/criticals present), `REVIEW` (warnings only), `MERGE` (clean), `CUSTOM` (manual recommendation).

Recommendations use GitHub Alert syntax (`[!CAUTION]`, `[!WARNING]`, `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`) for native rendering.

#### Inline Review Mode (`--inline`)

With `--inline`, findings are posted as inline comments on the PR using the GitHub Review API instead of (or in addition to) a single summary comment:

- Each finding that maps to a line in the PR diff becomes an inline comment on that line
- Auto-fix findings with a `SuggestedFix` use GitHub's `suggestion` syntax, enabling one-click apply
- Findings that cannot be mapped to diff lines are included in the review summary body
- The PR diff is fetched and parsed to validate that finding lines are within the diff (right side)
- Implies `--post-review`

### Review Patterns

Review Patterns are structured rules that systematically improve the review. They codify knowledge from past reviews and make it reusable.

#### Pattern Sources (descending priority)

1. **Repo-specific Patterns** (`.planwerk/review_patterns/*.md` in the target repo)
   - Created and maintained by the development team (Planwerk) themselves
   - Contain repo-specific knowledge (e.g., "In this repo, all DB queries must go through the QueryBuilder")
   - Versioned with the repository

2. **General Patterns** (`patterns/` in the planwerk-review repository)
   - Created by planwerk-review and recommended for adoption
   - Contain universally applicable review knowledge (e.g., "Hardcoded values in matrix workflows")
   - Grow over time through insights from conducted reviews

#### Prompt Budget

To keep review prompts within Claude's context window, patterns are capped at `--max-patterns` (default: `50`, env: `PLANWERK_MAX_PATTERNS`). When more patterns are loaded than the budget allows, the tool keeps the highest-priority patterns by severity (`BLOCKING` > `CRITICAL` > `WARNING` > `INFO`) and prints a warning to stderr. Set `--max-patterns 0` to disable truncation and inject all loaded patterns.

#### Pattern Format

```markdown
# Review Pattern: <Pattern Name>

**Review-Area**: <architecture|security|quality|testing|workflow|...>
**Detection-Hint**: <Description of when/how this pattern should be detected>
**Severity**: <BLOCKING|CRITICAL|WARNING|INFO>
**Occurrences**: <Number of previous findings>

## What to check

<Detailed description of what to check>

## Why it matters

<Explanation of why this pattern is important>

## Examples from external reviews

### <ID> — <Source>
- **Feedback**: <Concrete feedback from an actual review>
- **What was missed**: <What was overlooked>
- **Fix**: <How it was fixed>
```

#### Knowledge Building

The tool systematically builds knowledge over time:

```
First Review           Subsequent Reviews       Mature System
────────────          ────────────────────      ─────────────
Claude /review   ──▶  Claude /review       ──▶  Claude /review
(no patterns)         + general patterns        + general patterns
                      + repo-specific           + repo-specific
      │               patterns                  patterns (many)
      ▼                     │                         │
Suggest new                 ▼                         ▼
patterns             Refine patterns            High-precision
                     + suggest new ones         reviews
```

**Knowledge building process:**

1. **After the first review**: The tool analyzes review results and suggests new general patterns that should be added to `patterns/`.
2. **For recurring findings**: When the same issue occurs across multiple repos, the `Occurrences` field is incremented and the pattern is refined.
3. **Repo-specific patterns**: The development team creates these themselves in `.planwerk/review_patterns/` based on their domain knowledge. planwerk-review picks them up automatically.

### GitHub Workflows

#### CI (`ci.yml`)

- **Trigger**: Push to `main`, Pull Requests
- **Jobs**:
  - `test`: `go test ./...` on matrix (Ubuntu, macOS)
  - `build`: `go build ./cmd/planwerk-review/`
  - `vet`: `go vet ./...`

#### Lint (`lint.yml`)

- **Trigger**: Push to `main`, Pull Requests
- **Jobs**:
  - `lint`: `golangci-lint run`

#### Release (`release.yml`)

- **Trigger**: Tag push (`v*`)
- **Jobs**:
  - GoReleaser: Binaries for Linux/macOS/Windows (amd64, arm64)
  - GitHub Release with changelog

### Dependencies

- **Go 1.25+**
- **Claude CLI**: Must be installed and authenticated on the system (`claude` in PATH)
- **gh CLI**: Required for fetching PR metadata and checkout (`gh` in PATH)
- **git**: Required for cloning repositories

### Prerequisites

1. Go 1.25+ installed (or download a release binary)
2. Claude CLI installed and authenticated (`claude` in PATH)
3. `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
4. Access to the target repository (for checkout/clone)

### Design Decisions

| # | Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Claude CLI invocation** | Once for the entire PR | More efficient; Claude sees full context across files |
| 2 | **Pattern delivery** | Inline in the prompt before `/review` | Patterns are prepended to the `/review` command so Claude considers them during its built-in review |
| 3 | **Result parsing** | Second Claude call for structuring | `/review` returns unstructured text; a second `claude -p` call converts it to JSON matching the `ReviewResult` schema |
| 4 | **Authentication** | `gh auth` | Simplest setup; leverages existing developer workflow |
| 5 | **Review caching** | Based on PR HEAD SHA | Avoids repeated reviews of unchanged PR state |
| 6 | **Propose: two-step Claude** | Analysis → Structure | First call explores codebase freely; second call converts to strict JSON schema |
| 7 | **Propose: cache invalidation** | Based on default branch HEAD SHA | Cache key includes `git ls-remote` HEAD, so proposals refresh when the repo changes |
| 8 | **Propose: output formats** | Markdown, JSON, Issues, Interactive | Markdown for reading, JSON for automation, Issues for templates, `--create-issues` for interactive `gh issue create` |
| 9 | **Review prompt structure** | Multi-section structured prompt | Persona framing, scope analysis, two-pass checklist, suppressions, and anti-sycophancy rules produce higher-quality, more consistent reviews (inspired by [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)) |
| 10 | **Actionability classification** | auto-fix / needs-discussion / architectural | Helps teams prioritize which findings to address immediately vs. discuss first |
| 11 | **Scope drift detection** | PR title + body analyzed before code review | Catches scope creep and missing requirements — often the most valuable review feedback |
| 12 | **PR comment posting** | `--post-review` updates existing comment | Idempotent: detects and replaces prior planwerk-review comment via HTML signature. Truncates to GitHub's 65 536-char limit. |
| 13 | **Adversarial review** | `--thorough` runs a second pass | Independent security-focused review merged with primary results, deduplicating by file+line+title |
| 14 | **Coverage map** | `--coverage-map` maps changed functions to tests | Produces a table rating each changed function's test coverage (★★★/★★/★/GAP) with separate E2E gap analysis for projects using Chainsaw or similar frameworks |
| 15 | **External command timeouts** | All `claude`, `gh`, `git` calls have timeouts | Claude: 15 min, git clone: 5 min, gh: 2 min — prevents indefinite blocking |
| 16 | **Test & doc verification** | Dedicated prompt section + checklist items for test/doc completeness | Missing tests and documentation are the most common review gaps; explicit checks at SEMANTIC severity ensure they are flagged consistently. E2E test detection covers Chainsaw (`chainsaw-test.yaml`), kuttl, Helm chart tests, and generic `e2e/` directories |
| 17 | **Enriched findings** | Code snippets, suggested fixes, confidence, fix class, line ranges, relationships | Enables downstream tooling (Claude Code, CI) to process, apply, and correlate findings programmatically |
| 18 | **Inline review comments** | `--inline` posts via GitHub Review API with `suggestion` syntax | Puts findings exactly where the code is; auto-fix suggestions become one-click "Apply suggestion" buttons on GitHub |
| 19 | **Machine-readable comment** | HTML comment with counts + verdict in Markdown output | CI scripts and Claude Code can parse review results without processing full Markdown |
| 20 | **Compact Markdown format** | Empty sections skipped, single-line metadata, GitHub Alert syntax | Reduces noise for human readers and GitHub rendering; no "No findings." placeholders |
| 21 | **Audit: reuse finding schema** | Same `ReviewResult`/`Finding` types as review | Audit findings drop straight into existing tooling, filters, and renderers — no parallel schema to maintain |
| 22 | **Audit: verdict phrasing** | `Action required` / `Improvements suggested` / `Codebase healthy` | PR merge verdicts (`Do not merge` / `Ready to merge`) do not apply to a full-codebase audit; audit-specific phrasing avoids misleading readers |
| 23 | **Audit: no patterns = error** | `audit` fails fast when no patterns load | An audit with zero patterns would produce an unfocused, generic review; surfacing the misconfiguration is better than silently running it |

### Future Extensions

- **Pattern suggestions**: Automatically generate new pattern suggestions after a review
- **Diff-based re-review**: Only check new changes since the last review
- **Multi-reviewer**: Integrate other review tools alongside Claude
- **Dashboard**: Overview of review statistics per repository
- **GitHub Action**: Publish as a GitHub Action for automated PR reviews
- **Propose: incremental analysis**: Track which proposals have been addressed across runs
